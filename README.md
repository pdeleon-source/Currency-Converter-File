# Currency-Converter-File
## Paul De Leon

This program is a basic currency converter, which will convert currency of the users choosing to 
another currency the user wishes. It will provide a numbered list to the user containing the available 
currencies, and once the user chooses a correct option, it will provide the list again, asking for which 
currency it would like to convert to. It will then offer the user the choice of whether they would like 
to convert only one numerical value, or enter numerous values from a set txt file where the program will 
take all the numbers within that file and convert them to the desired currency. It will use methods 
that will contain the most recent exchange rate between the two currencies and multiply that number with
the amount or amounts that the user enters, and return that amount in the second currency chosen. The 
languages that are currently offered are US Dollars, British Pound Sterling, Euros, Chinese Yuan, Japanese
Yen, Russian Rubles, South Korean Won, and Indian Rupees. There is proper input validation every step of 
the way.
The language that was utilized in the program is C++. No prior installations are necessary.
